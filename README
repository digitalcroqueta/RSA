In this project, I will show how to generate large prime numbers followed by 
implementing the RSA algorithm. Since it will be needed to compute large exponents 
as part of the RSA algorithm, the standard integer types (int – 16 or 32 bits, long 
int – 32 bits and even long long int – 64 bits) won’t be enough, so I will be use the BigInteger built-in class of Java.
